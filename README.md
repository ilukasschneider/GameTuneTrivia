# Game Tune Trivia

## Overview

**Game Tune Trivia** is a web application that combines my love for video game soundtracks with the challenge of trivia. This project was created as my first foray into Next.js and full-stack development. It serves as a platform for users to test their knowledge of video game music by guessing the game from which a particular tune originates.

Game Tune Trivia is a fun and educational project that allowed me to dive into Next.js and full-stack development. It blends my love for video game soundtracks with the excitement of learning new technologies. I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed building it! As this was my first project using Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript, the code might not be the best and there are definitely areas for improvement.  

## Features

- **Daily Tune Challenge**: Users can test their music knowledge with a new tune every day.
- **Random Tune Mode**: Users can challenge themselves with a random tune from the archive.
- **Progress Tracking**: The app tracks user progress and guess history.
- **Audio Visualizer**: An engaging audio visualizer enhances the user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability.
